ðŸª– Helmet Detection using YOLO
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project demonstrates a real-time helmet detection system using YOLOv11, implemented on Google Colab. The goal is to detect whether bike riders are wearing helmets or not, which can be used to improve road safety, surveillance, and law enforcement automation.

The model is trained on a custom dataset of bike riders with and without helmets and tested for real-time inference.
