# 🪖 Helmet Detection using YOLOv11  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates a real-time helmet detection system using **YOLOv11**, implemented on **Google Colab**.  
The goal is to detect whether bike riders are wearing helmets or not, which can help improve:  
- ✅ Road safety  
- ✅ Traffic surveillance  
- ✅ Law enforcement automation  

The model is trained on a **custom dataset of bike riders** with and without helmets and tested for **real-time inference**.
